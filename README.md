## Setup

You can open this project in any environment that supports JavaScript, HTML, CSS ... For example: Webstorm, IntelijIdea.
To work with Angular, you need to install a Node.js server and npm package manager if they are not present on the production machine.
We will be using the Angular CLI to compile the application. Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application, compile it.
To install Angular CLI, open the console / command line and execute the following command in it:

```sh
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

in order to open a project in a browser, you need to write the following command:

```sh
$ ng s -o
```
#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

 `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
